# Supermarket Comparison Website

A web application that helps users compare prices for their weekly grocery shopping across multiple UK supermarkets. The website calculates and tells you the best and cheapest place to get your weekly groceries by comparing your basket across a range of stores.

## Supported Supermarkets
Currently, the comparison includes the following UK supermarkets:

- [ASDA](https://groceries.asda.com)
- [Sainsbury's](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/groceries)
- [Aldi](https://groceries.aldi.co.uk)
- [Tesco](https://www.tesco.com/groceries)
- [Iceland](https://www.iceland.co.uk)
- [Morrisons](https://groceries.morrisons.com/)

## Website Structure

The project is built using the following technologies:

### Frontend:
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the basic structure and styling of the website.
- **React.js** or **Vue.js** for creating interactive components and handling the dynamic features of the website.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**, **Django**, or **Flask (Python)** to handle the logic for data processing, scraping supermarket prices, and serving the comparison results.

### Database:
- **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** for storing the price data and user preferences.

### Web Scraping Framework:
- **Scrapy** or **BeautifulSoup (Python)** for scraping supermarket websites and extracting product prices.
- **Selenium** may be used for more complex scraping scenarios where dynamic content is involved.

### Hosting:
- **AWS**, **Heroku**, or **DigitalOcean** for hosting the application.

### Analytics:
- **Google Analytics** for tracking user behavior and improving the user experience.
